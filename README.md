# Crop Yield Prediction Project

By predicting crop yields, this project aims to improve agricultural practices and support decision-making in agriculture. It leverages data cleaning, visualization, and machine learning techniques to achieve these goals.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Preprocessing data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating visualizations to better understand the data and uncover patterns.
- **Machine Learning**: Implementing machine learning models to predict crop yields.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (version 3.6 or higher)
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
